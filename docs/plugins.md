# Parties Server Plugins

Parties supports trusted native server plugins. Plugins are loaded by the server
at startup and can add chat commands, inspect chat messages, create server-owned
bot users, send bot chat, join bots to voice channels, send Opus bot audio, and
query read-only session/user/channel state.

Plugins run in-process. They are not sandboxed. A plugin crash can crash the
server, so only load plugins you trust.

## Feature Scope

Implemented plugin features:

- Native dynamic library loading from a configured plugin directory.
- `plugin.toml` manifests with default-deny server allow-listing.
- Plugin manifest variables passed to `parties_plugin_init`.
- Per-plugin permission grants.
- Lifecycle callbacks.
- Session authenticated/disconnected callbacks.
- Chat command registration and client advertisement.
- Chat command dispatch from normal chat input.
- Chat message observation, rejection, and replacement.
- Server-owned persistent bot users.
- Bot display-name updates.
- Bot chat messages stored and broadcast like normal chat.
- Bot voice join/leave presence.
- Bot Opus packet fan-out through the normal voice path.
- Read-only session, user, voice channel, and text channel lookup APIs.
- Bot voice-channel lookup and move-to-user-voice helper.

Out of scope for the current API:

- Client-side plugins.
- Direct database access.
- Admin mutation APIs.
- Plugin KV storage.
- Timer/scheduler APIs.
- Voice receive/transcription hooks.
- Process isolation or sandboxing.

## Scope Boundaries

This feature defines the server plugin ABI and the host functions documented in
this file. It does not turn every existing Parties subsystem into a public,
thread-safe extension surface.

Threading support applies to the documented `Host` functions only. Plugins may
call those functions from plugin-owned worker threads, for example to pace bot
audio, and must treat them as blocking calls. This is not a general scheduler or
timer API, and plugins must still own, stop, and join their worker threads.

Bot users are persistent synthetic users. The stable identity is `(plugin_id,
key)`, and `destroy_bot_user` invalidates the runtime handle without deleting
the persisted user row. Ephemeral bot database cleanup and broader user-row
lifecycle policy are outside this feature.

Command authorization for plugin commands is limited to `CommandDefinition`
`min_role` plus the `caller_role` value passed to callbacks. Richer server-side
policy, named command permissions, and admin/moderation mutation APIs are outside
this feature.

`AbiHeader` is enforced for this plugin ABI: the host rejects major-version
mismatches and copies only the common prefix for output structs. It is not a
general C++ binary-compatibility layer for arbitrary compiler, packing, or
calling-convention differences. Plugins must build against the public C ABI
header for the target platform.

## Directory Layout

Plugins are discovered by recursively scanning the configured plugin directory
for files named `plugin.toml`.

Example layout:

```text
plugins/
  music_bot/
    plugin.toml
    music_bot.dll
```

Platform library extensions:

| Platform | Extension |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `.dll` |
| Linux | `.so` |
| macOS | `.dylib` |

## Server Configuration

Plugin loading is disabled by default.

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = true
directory = "plugins"

[[plugins.allow]]
id = "parties.music_bot"
enabled = true
permissions = [
  "read_sessions",
  "read_users",
  "read_channels",
  "read_chat",
  "moderate_chat",
  "create_chat_commands",
  "create_bot_users",
  "send_bot_chat",
  "join_bot_voice",
  "send_bot_audio"
]
```

Loading is default-deny:

- The plugin manifest declares requested permissions.
- The server grants permissions through `[[plugins.allow]]`.
- The effective permissions are the intersection of requested and granted
  permissions.
- Missing permissions do not stop the plugin from loading unless plugin init
  depends on the denied host call.

## Plugin Manifest

Each plugin must provide `plugin.toml` next to the library.

```toml
id = "parties.music_bot"
name = "Music Bot"
version = "0.1.0"
api_version = "1.0"
library = "music_bot.dll"
# Optional integrity pin for the library bytes, lowercase hex without colons.
sha256 = "0123456789abcdef..."

variables = {
  youtube_api_key = "env:YOUTUBE_API_KEY",
  default_playlist = "favorites"
}

permissions = [
  "read_sessions",
  "read_users",
  "read_channels",
  "read_chat",
  "moderate_chat",
  "create_chat_commands",
  "create_bot_users",
  "send_bot_chat",
  "join_bot_voice",
  "send_bot_audio"
]
```

Rules:

- `id` must match the server allow-list entry.
- `api_version` must currently be `"1.0"`.
- `library` must be a bare filename next to `plugin.toml`; absolute paths,
  subdirectories, and `..` are rejected.
- `sha256` is optional. When present, the server hashes the library before
  loading it and rejects mismatches.
- `variables` is optional. Keys and values must be strings.
- Only one plugin with a given `id` may load.
- Unsupported manifests are skipped; one bad plugin does not stop other plugins
  from loading.

Variables may also be written as a TOML table:

```toml
[variables]
youtube_api_key = "env-or-secret-name"
default_playlist = "favorites"
```

The server passes variables to `parties_plugin_init` as immutable key/value
pairs in `Host`. They are plugin-local configuration, not permissions or
secrets management. Do not put long-lived secrets in world-readable manifests.

If a variable value starts with `env:`, the server resolves the rest of the
value as an environment variable at plugin load time:

```toml
variables = { youtube_api_key = "env:YOUTUBE_API_KEY" }
```

The plugin receives the resolved environment value, not the literal `env:...`
string. If the environment variable is missing, the plugin manifest is rejected
and the plugin is not loaded.

## Permissions

| Permission | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| `read_sessions` | Read session snapshots, resolve a user's voice channel, move a bot to a user's voice channel. |
| `read_users` | Read basic user records and resolve a user by display name. |
| `read_channels` | Read voice/text channel metadata and channel lists. |
| `read_chat` | Observe chat messages with `on_chat_message`. |
| `moderate_chat` | Reject or replace user chat messages. |
| `create_chat_commands` | Register slash-style chat commands. |
| `create_bot_users` | Create, destroy, and rename server-owned bot users. |
| `send_bot_chat` | Send stored chat messages as bot users. |
| `join_bot_voice` | Join, leave, and move bot users in voice channels. |
| `send_bot_audio` | Send Opus packets as bot users. |

Permissions are policy checks between the host and a trusted plugin. They are
not a sandbox or an RCE boundary against the plugin itself. The plugin directory,
manifests, and libraries must be writable only by the server operator/principal.

## ABI Rules

The public header is:

```text
sdk/include/parties/plugin_api.h
```

All ABI structs begin with:

```cpp
struct AbiHeader {
    uint32_t size;
    uint16_t api_major;
    uint16_t api_minor;
};
```

Initialize ABI structs with:

```cpp
parties::plugin::make_abi_header<T>()
```

The host validates ABI headers on plugin registration and on host-call
out-parameters. Before passing an output struct to the host, initialize its
`abi` field. For arrays, initialize every element you provide. The host is the
ABI authority: a major-version mismatch is rejected, and scalar out-parameters
copy only the common prefix declared by the plugin-provided `abi.size`.

Host function pointers are appended to `Host` over time. Plugins should check
both the function pointer and `host->abi.size` before using a newer field when
they need to run against older servers.

Required export:

```cpp
extern "C" bool parties_plugin_init(const parties::plugin::Host* host,
                                    parties::plugin::Registration* registration);
```

Optional export:

```cpp
extern "C" void parties_plugin_shutdown();
```

The server owns the `Host::context` pointer. Plugins may copy the `Host` table
for later synchronous host calls. Manifest variable pointers in `Host` remain
valid for the plugin lifetime.

## Handles

```cpp
using SessionId = uint32_t;
using UserId = uint32_t;
using ChannelId = uint32_t;
using MessageId = uint64_t;

struct Bot;
using BotHandle = Bot*;
```

`SessionId`, `UserId`, `ChannelId`, and `MessageId` are scalar identifiers.
`BotHandle` is an opaque server-owned handle. Plugins must pass `BotHandle` back
to the host but must not dereference it or persist it across server runs.

## Snapshot Structs

String fields are fixed-size buffers owned by the output struct. Long strings
are truncated and always null-terminated.

```cpp
constexpr size_t MAX_NAME_LEN = 128;
constexpr size_t MAX_FINGERPRINT_LEN = 192;

struct SessionInfo {
    AbiHeader abi;
    SessionId session_id;
    UserId user_id;
    ChannelId voice_channel_id;
    uint8_t role;
    uint8_t authenticated;
    uint8_t muted;
    uint8_t deafened;
    char username[MAX_NAME_LEN];
};

struct UserInfo {
    AbiHeader abi;
    UserId user_id;
    uint8_t role;
    uint8_t is_bot;
    char display_name[MAX_NAME_LEN];
    char fingerprint[MAX_FINGERPRINT_LEN];
    char bot_owner_plugin[MAX_NAME_LEN];
    char bot_key[MAX_NAME_LEN];
};

struct ChannelInfo {
    AbiHeader abi;
    ChannelId channel_id;
    uint32_t user_count;
    int32_t max_users;
    int32_t sort_order;
    char name[MAX_NAME_LEN];
};
```

For text channels, `user_count` and `max_users` are currently `0`.

## Host API

The server passes a `Host` table to `parties_plugin_init`.

### Manifest Variables

```cpp
struct PluginVariable {
    AbiHeader abi;
    const char* key;
    const char* value;
};

struct Host {
    // ...
    const PluginVariable* variables;
    size_t variable_count;
};
```

Variables come from `plugin.toml` and are available during
`parties_plugin_init`. Values are strings exactly as configured. Plugins should
copy values they need after shutdown begins.

### Logging And Time

```cpp
void (*log)(void* context, uint8_t level, const char* message);
uint64_t (*now_ms)(void* context);
```

`log` writes through the server logger with the plugin id attached.

`now_ms` returns a monotonic millisecond timestamp.

### Chat Commands

```cpp
bool (*create_chat_commands)(void* context,
                             const CommandDefinition* commands,
                             size_t command_count);
```

Requires `create_chat_commands`.

Rules:

- Command names do not include the leading slash.
- Names must be non-empty, at most 64 bytes, and contain only ASCII
  alphanumeric characters, `_`, or `-`.
- Command names are globally unique across loaded plugins.
- Registered commands are sent to clients after authentication.

### Bot Users

```cpp
bool (*create_bot_user)(void* context,
                        const char* key,
                        const char* display_name,
                        BotHandle* out_bot,
                        UserId* out_user_id);

bool (*destroy_bot_user)(void* context, BotHandle bot);

bool (*set_bot_display_name)(void* context,
                             BotHandle bot,
                             const char* display_name);
```

Requires `create_bot_users`.

Bot identity is stable by `(plugin_id, key)`. Calling `create_bot_user` again
with the same key reuses the existing persisted synthetic user row. Bot users
are stored in `users` with `is_bot`, `bot_owner_plugin`, and `bot_key` metadata.

Destroying a bot invalidates the runtime `BotHandle`, but it does not delete the
persisted user row. Destroying a bot that is in voice broadcasts the normal
voice leave event before the handle is invalidated. Destroyed runtime handles
are reaped, and each plugin is limited to 64 live bot handles.

### Bot Chat

```cpp
bool (*send_bot_chat)(void* context,
                      BotHandle bot,
                      ChannelId text_channel_id,
                      const char* text,
                      MessageId* out_message_id);
```

Requires `send_bot_chat`.

Bot chat:

- validates the target text channel,
- follows normal message length limits,
- stores the message in the database,
- broadcasts the normal `CHAT_MESSAGE` payload,
- does not recursively invoke `on_chat_message`.

### Bot Voice

```cpp
bool (*join_bot_voice)(void* context,
                       BotHandle bot,
                       ChannelId voice_channel_id);

bool (*leave_bot_voice)(void* context, BotHandle bot);

bool (*send_bot_voice_packet)(void* context,
                              BotHandle bot,
                              uint16_t sequence,
                              const uint8_t* opus_payload,
                              size_t opus_payload_len);
```

`join_bot_voice` and `leave_bot_voice` require `join_bot_voice`.

`send_bot_voice_packet` requires `send_bot_audio`.

Voice packet expectations:

- Payload is Opus, not PCM.
- Sample rate should be 48 kHz.
- Frame duration should match normal voice pacing, currently 20 ms.
- The plugin provides only the Opus payload and sequence number.
- The server builds and forwards the normal voice packet shape:

```text
VOICE_PACKET_TYPE u8
sender_user_id u32
sequence u16
opus_payload bytes
```

Audio is forwarded to authenticated users in the same voice channel who are not
deafened.

### Session And User Lookup

```cpp
bool (*user_voice_channel)(void* context,
                           UserId user_id,
                           ChannelId* out_voice_channel_id);

bool (*get_session_info)(void* context,
                         SessionId session,
                         SessionInfo* out_info);

bool (*get_user_info)(void* context,
                      UserId user_id,
                      UserInfo* out_info);

bool (*find_user_by_name)(void* context,
                          const char* display_name,
                          UserId* out_user_id);
```

Permissions:

- `user_voice_channel` requires `read_sessions`.
- `get_session_info` requires `read_sessions`.
- `get_user_info` requires `read_users`.
- `find_user_by_name` requires `read_users`.

`user_voice_channel` returns `true` when the user id is known to the live server,
including server-owned bots. It writes `0` when the known user is not currently
in voice. It returns `false` for invalid arguments, missing permission, or an
unknown/offline user id.

`get_session_info` only returns live session state. Bot users do not have
sessions.

`get_user_info` reads persisted users and can return offline users.

`find_user_by_name` currently matches display names exactly.

### Channel Lookup

```cpp
bool (*get_voice_channel_info)(void* context,
                               ChannelId channel_id,
                               ChannelInfo* out_info);

bool (*get_text_channel_info)(void* context,
                              ChannelId channel_id,
                              ChannelInfo* out_info);

bool (*list_voice_channels)(void* context,
                            ChannelInfo* out_channels,
                            size_t* inout_count);

bool (*list_text_channels)(void* context,
                           ChannelInfo* out_channels,
                           size_t* inout_count);
```

Requires `read_channels`.

List APIs use a two-pass pattern:

```cpp
size_t count = 0;
host->list_voice_channels(host->context, nullptr, &count);

std::vector<parties::plugin::ChannelInfo> channels(count);
for (auto& channel : channels)
    channel.abi = parties::plugin::make_abi_header<parties::plugin::ChannelInfo>();
size_t capacity = channels.size();
bool complete = host->list_voice_channels(host->context,
                                          channels.data(),
                                          &capacity);
```

On return, `inout_count` is set to the total number of channels. If the provided
buffer is too small, the host copies as many entries as fit and returns `false`.

### Bot Voice Helpers

```cpp
bool (*bot_voice_channel)(void* context,
                          BotHandle bot,
                          ChannelId* out_voice_channel_id);

bool (*move_bot_to_user_voice)(void* context,
                               BotHandle bot,
                               UserId user_id);
```

`bot_voice_channel` reads a bot owned by the calling plugin. It writes `0` when
the bot is not currently in voice.

`move_bot_to_user_voice` requires both `read_sessions` and `join_bot_voice`. It
resolves the target user's current voice channel, fails if the user is unknown or
not in voice, and then joins the bot to that voice channel.

## Registration API

Plugins fill a `Registration` table during init.

```cpp
struct Registration {
    AbiHeader abi;

    void (*on_server_started)();
    void (*on_server_stopping)();

    void (*on_session_authenticated)(SessionId session);
    void (*on_session_disconnected)(SessionId session,
                                    UserId user_id,
                                    ChannelId voice_channel_id);

    void (*on_chat_message)(const ChatMessage* message, ChatDecision* decision);
    void (*on_chat_command)(const ChatCommandInvocation* invocation);
};
```

Callbacks are optional. Null callbacks are ignored.
Callbacks must not throw. The server catches C++ exceptions at the ABI boundary,
logs the failure, disables the offending plugin, and removes its registered
commands. Long-running callbacks are logged; plugins should keep callbacks
short because they run on the server main loop.

Callback timing:

- `on_server_started` runs after the server starts and plugins load.
- `on_server_stopping` runs while the plugin manager shuts down.
- `on_session_authenticated` runs after a client authenticates.
- `on_session_disconnected` runs during disconnect cleanup on the server main
  loop.
- `on_chat_message` runs before user chat is stored or broadcast.
- `on_chat_command` runs when a registered slash command is invoked.

## Chat Message Moderation

```cpp
struct ChatMessage {
    AbiHeader abi;
    SessionId session_id;
    UserId author_user_id;
    ChannelId text_channel_id;
    const char* author_name;
    const char* text;
    uint8_t attachment_count;
};

enum class ChatDecisionCode : uint8_t {
    Continue = 0,
    Reject = 1,
    ReplaceText = 2,
};

struct ChatDecision {
    AbiHeader abi;
    uint8_t code;
    const char* replacement_text;
    const char* rejection_reason;
};
```

Rules:

- `read_chat` allows observation.
- `moderate_chat` is required for `Reject` and `ReplaceText`.
- Plugins run in load order.
- If a plugin replaces text, later plugins see the updated text.
- If a plugin rejects text, dispatch stops and the sender receives an error.
- Pointers in `ChatMessage` are valid only during the callback.

## Chat Commands

```cpp
struct CommandDefinition {
    AbiHeader abi;
    const char* name;
    const char* description;
    const char* usage;
    uint8_t min_role;
};

enum class CommandArgType : uint8_t {
    String = 0,
    Bool = 1,
    Int8 = 2,
    UInt8 = 3,
    Int16 = 4,
    UInt16 = 5,
    Int32 = 6,
    UInt32 = 7,
    Int64 = 8,
    UInt64 = 9,
    Float = 10,
    Double = 11,
};

struct CommandArgumentValue {
    AbiHeader abi;
    const char* name;
    uint8_t type;
    uint8_t present;
    int64_t i64_value;
    uint64_t u64_value;
    double f64_value;
    uint8_t bool_value;
    const char* string_value;
};

struct ChatCommandInvocation {
    AbiHeader abi;
    SessionId session_id;
    UserId user_id;
    ChannelId text_channel_id;
    uint8_t caller_role;
    const char* command_name;
    const char* args;
    const char* raw_text;
    const CommandArgumentValue* parsed_args;
    size_t parsed_arg_count;
};
```

`usage` is also the command argument schema. The server parses it when the plugin
registers commands, rejects invalid schemas, and parses user input before calling
`on_chat_command`.

`min_role` is the least-privileged role allowed to invoke the command. Role
values use the server role ordering: `0 = Owner`, `1 = Admin`, `2 = Moderator`,
`3 = User`, `4 = Bot`; lower numbers are more privileged. The default
zero-initialized C++ SDK value is `User`.

Schema syntax:

- The first token must be the command name with a slash: `/restart-audio-receiver`.
- Required arguments use braces: `{userId:uint32}`.
- Optional arguments use brackets: `[reason:string]`.
- Argument names may contain ASCII letters, digits, and `_`.
- Required arguments must not appear after optional arguments.
- `string...` captures the rest of the line and must be the final argument.
- Old display-only placeholders such as `[text]` or `<url>` are invalid.

Supported argument types:

| Type | Parsed field |
| --- | --- |
| `bool` | `bool_value`, accepted values are `true`, `false`, `1`, `0` |
| `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64` | `i64_value` |
| `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64` | `u64_value` |
| `float`, `double` | `f64_value` |
| `string` | `string_value` |
| `string...` | `string_value` |

Examples:

```cpp
command.name = "restart-audio-receiver";
command.usage = "/restart-audio-receiver {userId:uint32}";
```

```cpp
command.name = "play";
command.usage = "/play {url:string} [announce:bool]";
```

```cpp
command.name = "say";
command.usage = "/say [text:string...]";
```

Command invocation rules:

- A user sends normal chat text such as `/play https://example`.
- If the first token matches a registered command, the server dispatches the
  command to the owning plugin.
- If the caller role is less privileged than `min_role`, the server returns
  `Permission denied` and does not call the plugin.
- Registered command invocations are not stored as normal chat.
- Unknown slash commands return a server error.
- Missing required arguments, invalid typed values, and extra arguments return a
  server error before the plugin callback runs.
- `args` contains the raw argument text after the command name.
- `caller_role` contains the invoking user's current server role.
- `parsed_args` contains one entry per schema argument. Optional missing
  arguments are present with `present == 0`.
- Pointers in `ChatCommandInvocation` are valid only during the callback.

parties::plugin::UserId bot_user_id = 0;

bool ensure_bot() {
    if (bot)
        return true;
    return g_host.create_bot_user &&
           g_host.create_bot_user(g_host.context,
                                  "default",

    if (!g_host.move_bot_to_user_voice(g_host.context, bot, invocation->user_id)) {
        send_reply(invocation->text_channel_id, "Join a voice channel first.");
        return;
    }

    send_reply(invocation->text_channel_id, "Joined your voice channel.");
}
```

```cpp
void send_silence_frame() {
    if (!bot || !g_host.send_bot_voice_packet)
        return;

    static uint16_t sequence = 0;

    // Opus comfort-noise/silence payload used by the test plugin. Real plugins
    // should encode actual 48 kHz Opus frames.
    const uint8_t opus_payload[] = {0xf8, 0xff, 0xfe};

    g_host.send_bot_voice_packet(g_host.context,
                                 bot,
                                 sequence++,
                                 opus_payload,
                                 sizeof(opus_payload));
}
```

## Lookup Example

```cpp
void describe_user(const parties::plugin::ChatCommandInvocation* invocation) {
    if (!g_host.get_user_info || !g_host.user_voice_channel)
        return;

    parties::plugin::UserInfo user{};
    user.abi = parties::plugin::make_abi_header<parties::plugin::UserInfo>();
    if (!g_host.get_user_info(g_host.context, invocation->user_id, &user))
        return;

    parties::plugin::ChannelId voice_channel = 0;
    const bool known_live_user =
        g_host.user_voice_channel(g_host.context, invocation->user_id, &voice_channel);

    char message[256];
    std::snprintf(message, sizeof(message),
                  "%s is %s voice channel %u",
                  user.display_name,
                  known_live_user && voice_channel != 0 ? "in" : "not in",
                  voice_channel);

    send_reply(invocation->text_channel_id, message);
}
```

## Threading Model

Plugin lifecycle, chat, command, and session callbacks are dispatched from the
server main loop.

Host calls are synchronous and may be called from plugin-owned worker threads.
When a worker thread calls a host function that touches server state, the server
marshals that request onto the server main loop and blocks the caller until the
result is available. Calls made from server-dispatched plugin callbacks execute
inline on the main loop.

Plugins are still responsible for their own memory and thread ownership:

- Do not unload or free plugin-owned data while a worker thread might still use
  it.
- Stop and join plugin-owned worker threads from `parties_plugin_shutdown`.
- Treat host calls as blocking calls. Bot audio workers should pace packets and
  avoid unbounded buffering if the server loop is busy.
- Host-provided callback pointers remain valid only for the duration documented
  by the specific callback.

## Failure Behavior

The server handles plugin failures as follows:

- Global plugin loading can be disabled.
- Missing plugin directories log a warning and startup continues.
- Bad manifests, unsupported API versions, denied plugin ids, failed library
  loads, and failed init calls disable only that plugin.
- Duplicate plugin ids are rejected.
- Plugin callback exceptions are caught, logged, and disable the offending
  plugin.
- Missing permissions make host calls fail and log a warning.
- Invalid or duplicate commands are rejected and logged.
- Missing `parties_plugin_shutdown` is allowed.
- Native crashes, memory corruption, and infinite loops are process/server
  failures; plugins are trusted in-process code, not sandboxed code.

## Build Integration

The in-tree example plugin is:

```text
examples/plugins/bot_echo
```

It is built when `BUILD_PLUGIN_EXAMPLES` is enabled and copied under the server
runtime plugin directory. It registers these commands:

- `/botping [text:string...]`
- `/botreset`
- `/botjoin`
- `/botleave`
- `/botvoice`
- `/botapi [displayName:string]`
- `/bottypes {flag:bool} {i8:int8} {u8:uint8} {i16:int16} {u16:uint16} {i32:int32} {u32:uint32} {i64:int64} {u64:uint64} {f:float} {d:double} [note:string...]`
- `/botvars`
- `/botworker`

`/botapi` is an integration-test command that exercises the read-only lookup
host APIs and bot voice helper APIs through the real plugin boundary.

`/bottypes` is an integration-test command that exercises the typed command
argument parser through the real plugin boundary.

`/botvars` is an integration-test command that echoes a value read from
`plugin.toml` during plugin init.

`/botworker` is an integration-test command that exercises a host call from a
plugin-owned worker thread.
